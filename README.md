# Introduction to Real-Time Apps with AngularJS

Example code for a lecture at [CityOS Hackathon: Smart
Sarajevo](http://cityos.io/) about using JavaScript on front-end for real-time
visualisation using AngularJS and Highcharts.

The commit history is made as clean as possible and could be followed as a
tutorial.

The demo uses the following libraries:

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
* [angular-websocket](https://github.com/gdi2290/angular-websocket)
* [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/)
* [highcharts-ng](https://github.com/pablojim/highcharts-ng)
